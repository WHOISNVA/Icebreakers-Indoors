## 🔍 Current Issue

The app is loading but experiencing a crash. Looking at the logs:

```
LOG  ✅ IndoorAtlas native module loaded successfully
LOG  ⚠️ IndoorAtlas AR wayfinding not available on this platform
LOG  🔔 UserScreen: Setting up PingService for user-123
LOG  🔔 UserScreen: No lastOrderId yet, waiting for order...
ERROR  Your app just crashed.
```

The crash appears to be:
1. App loads successfully
2. IndoorAtlas module loads
3. UserScreen initializes
4. Then crashes when trying to show an error screen

**Root Cause**: The Expo Dev Launcher's error screen itself is crashing with a NullPointerException.

This suggests there's a JavaScript error happening that triggers the error screen, but the error screen can't display it.

## Next Steps

1. Check for JavaScript errors before the crash
2. May need to disable Expo Dev Launcher error handling
3. Or build a release/production build to see the real error
4. Check if there's a navigation or routing issue
