# üì± Building for Your iPhone - Step by Step

## The Problem
You were opening **Expo Go** (the pre-built app), but we need to build a **custom development build** because we added native IndoorAtlas modules.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Build with Xcode Properly

### Step 1: Open Terminal and Run This Command

```bash
cd /Users/whoisnva/Desktop/IcebreakersIndoors/DeliveryTrackerExpo
npx expo run:ios --device
```

**Then select your iPhone from the list when prompted.**

### Step 2: Alternative - Use Xcode with Correct Settings

If the command line doesn't work, use Xcode:

1. **Open the workspace:**
   ```bash
   open /Users/whoisnva/Desktop/IcebreakersIndoors/DeliveryTrackerExpo/ios/DeliveryTrackerExpo.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **In Xcode:**
   - **Top toolbar**: Click where it says "DeliveryTrackerExpo > [Device]"
   - **Select your iPhone** (should say "iPhone" or "iPhone 13 Pro Max")
   - **Important**: Make sure it's NOT "Any iOS Device" or a simulator

3. **Check the Scheme:**
   - Click on "DeliveryTrackerExpo" (next to the play button)
   - Make sure it says **"DeliveryTrackerExpo"** (not "Expo Go")

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Press the **Play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)** or press `Cmd + R`
   - This will take 2-5 minutes the first time

5. **Watch for Build Progress:**
   - You'll see "Building..." at the top
   - Wait for it to complete
   - It will automatically install on your iPhone

### Step 3: Trust the Developer Certificate

After the app installs, you might see "Untrusted Developer":

1. On your iPhone: **Settings** ‚Üí **General** ‚Üí **VPN & Device Management**
2. Tap your developer profile (your email)
3. Tap **Trust**
4. Open the app again
