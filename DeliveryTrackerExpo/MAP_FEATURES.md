## 💡 Use Cases

### **Multi-Order Delivery Planning:**

**Scenario:** You have 5 pending orders

1. Tap **"🗺️ View All (5)"**
2. See all 5 orange pins spread across the venue
3. Identify closest cluster of orders
4. Tap the nearest pin
5. Navigate there first
6. Deliver and mark complete
7. Back to map - see remaining 4 pins
8. Repeat for optimal route

### **3D Indoor Navigation:**

**Scenario:** Delivering to a multi-story hotel

1. Open map in 3D view (tilt gesture)
2. See building heights in perspective
3. Identify which tower/wing
4. Rotate map to match your view
5. Walk while watching distance decrease
6. Use building shapes as landmarks
7. Arrive at exact location

### **Visual Orientation:**

**Scenario:** In unfamiliar area

1. Tilt map to 3D
2. Rotate to match your facing direction
3. See buildings ahead of you on map
4. Use as visual reference
5. Walk towards destination
6. Buildings on map match real buildings

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Map Configuration:**

```typescript
<MapView
  showsBuildings={true}        // 3D buildings
  showsIndoors={true}          // Indoor floor plans
  pitchEnabled={true}          // Allow 3D tilt
  rotateEnabled={true}         // Allow rotation
  showsCompass={true}          // Show compass
  showsUserLocation={true}     // Show blue dot
  followsUserLocation={true}   // Auto-follow (when viewing all)
/>
```

### **AR-Like Features:**

While not true AR (camera overlay), the map provides AR-like benefits:

- **Real-time positioning** - Your location updates every second
- **Orientation aware** - Can rotate map to match your view
- **3D perspective** - See depth and building heights
- **Distance feedback** - Live distance calculations
- **Visual landmarks** - 3D buildings help orientation

### **For True AR:**

To add camera-based AR in the future, you'd need:
- `expo-camera` - Access device camera
- `expo-gl` - 3D graphics rendering
- AR framework like `react-native-arkit` (iOS) or `react-native-arcore` (Android)
- Overlay direction arrows on camera view
- Depth sensing for object placement

## 📊 Performance

| Feature | Performance Impact |
|---------|-------------------|
| Multiple pins (< 20) | ✅ Minimal |
| 3D buildings | ⚠️ Moderate (slight battery drain) |
| Real-time tracking | ✅ Minimal |
| Indoor floor plans | ⚠️ Moderate (when available) |
| Map rotation | ✅ Minimal |

**Battery Optimization:**
- Map only tracks location when open
- Stops tracking when closed
- No background location usage
- Efficient update intervals (1 second)

---

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### **Before (Old):**
- Single order navigation only
- Flat 2D map
- Must switch to external app for multiple orders
- No visual depth perception

### **After (Now):**
- All orders visible simultaneously
- 3D buildings for depth
- Interactive gestures
- Stay in-app
- Better spatial awareness

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **For Best Experience:**

1. **Enable Location Always** - Better accuracy
2. **Allow in background** - Smoother tracking
3. **Use WiFi** - Better indoor positioning
4. **Calibrate compass** - Wave phone in figure-8
5. **Good GPS signal** - Near windows when indoors
6. **Battery > 20%** - 3D features use more power

### **Troubleshooting:**

**Pins not showing?**
- Check if orders have valid coordinates
- Zoom out to see if they're off-screen
- Tap "View All" to auto-center

**3D not working?**
- Ensure device supports 3D (iPhone 5s+ / modern Android)
- Try pinch to zoom first (initializes renderer)
- Restart app if needed

**Location not updating?**
- Check location permissions
- Ensure GPS is enabled
- Move near window if indoors
- Check network connection

**Map rotated wrong way?**
- Tap compass icon to reset to north
- Calibrate device compass (Settings → Privacy → Location Services → Compass Calibration)
