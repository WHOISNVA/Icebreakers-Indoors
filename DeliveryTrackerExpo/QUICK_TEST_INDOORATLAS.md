## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Seeing "GPS fallback"

**Quick Checks:**
1. Are you on a **physical iPhone**? (Simulator won't work)
2. Did the app **rebuild** after pod install?
3. Is **location permission** granted?

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf build DerivedData
cd ..
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### Issue: Build Errors

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock build
pod install
cd ..
npx expo run:ios
```

## 📊 Expected Accuracy Improvement

### Before (GPS):
- Indoor: 10-50m
- Floor: Estimated (often wrong)
- Update rate: 1-3 seconds

### After (IndoorAtlas):
- Indoor: **1-3m** ✨
- Floor: **Direct detection** ✨
- Update rate: **0.5-1 second** ✨

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] App builds without errors
- [ ] Console shows "IndoorAtlas iOS SDK initialized"
- [ ] Order creation shows "Position from IndoorAtlas"
- [ ] Accuracy is < 5m (not 10-50m)
- [ ] Floor number is detected (if in mapped venue)
- [ ] AR navigation shows "source: indooratlas"

## 🎉 What's Next?

### If It's Working:
1. Test AR navigation - should be much smoother!
2. Compare delivery accuracy to before
3. Check battery usage (IndoorAtlas uses more power)

### If Still on GPS:
1. Check build logs for errors
2. Verify you're on a physical device
3. Make sure venue is mapped in IndoorAtlas
4. See full documentation in `INDOORATLAS_INSTALLED.md`
