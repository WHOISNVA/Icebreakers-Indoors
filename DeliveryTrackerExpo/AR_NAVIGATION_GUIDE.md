# 📹 True AR Navigation Guide

## 🎉 What is AR Navigation?

**Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation** overlays directional information **directly on your camera view**. You point your phone at the real world, and the app shows:
- 🧭 **Giant arrow** pointing to your destination
- 📏 **Live distance** updating as you walk
- 🎯 **Visual confirmation** when pointing the right direction
- 📱 **Turn-by-turn directions** (text)

---

## ✨ How It Works

### **The Technology:**

1. **Camera** - Shows live video of what's in front of you
2. **GPS** - Tracks your exact location
3. **Magnetometer** - Knows which direction you're facing
4. **Math** - Calculates bearing (direction) to destination
5. **AR Overlay** - Draws arrow/info on top of camera view

### **The Experience:**

```
What you see through your camera:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏢 Real Building                │
│                                  │
│         ▲  ← BIG ARROW           │
│        ⬤   pointing direction    │
│       175m  distance             │
│                                  │
│  🏢 Real Hallway                 │

## 📱 How to Use AR Navigation

### **Step 1: Enable AR**

1. Go to **Bartender Screen**
2. Find the order you want to deliver
3. Tap **"📹 AR View"** button (purple)
4. **Grant camera permission** when asked
5. **Grant location permission** when asked

### **Step 2: Point Your Phone**

1. Camera opens showing real-world view
2. Hold phone **vertically** (portrait mode)
3. Point camera **forward** (where you're walking)
4. You'll see a **giant blue arrow** overlaid on camera

### **Step 3: Follow the Arrow**

The arrow shows you which way to turn:

| Arrow Position | What It Means | Action |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **↑ Center, Green** | Going correct direction! | Keep walking straight |
| **↗️ Slightly right** | Turn a little right | Adjust course right |
| **➡️ Hard right** | Turn right now | Turn right 90° |
| **↘️ Behind right** | Behind you (right side) | Turn around to the right |
| **⬇️ Straight down** | Behind you | Turn around 180° |
| **↙️ Behind left** | Behind you (left side) | Turn around to the left |
| **⬅️ Hard left** | Turn left now | Turn left 90° |
| **↖️ Slightly left** | Turn a little left | Adjust course left |

### **Step 4: Arrive**

1. As you get close, distance shrinks: "175m → 85m → 40m → 15m"
2. When within **15 meters**:
   - Arrow disappears
   - **"🎉 YOU'VE ARRIVED!"** appears
   - Alert pops up
3. Tap **"Mark Delivered"** to complete

## 🚶 Walking with AR

### **Best Practices:**

**✅ DO:**
- Hold phone at **chest/shoulder height**
- Point camera **forward** in walking direction
- Keep **moving slowly** for better GPS accuracy
- **Follow the arrow** - it knows best!
- Use in **well-lit areas** (camera works better)
- **Stop and recalibrate** if arrow seems wrong

**❌ DON'T:**
- Point camera at the ground
- Walk too fast (GPS can't keep up)
- Cover the camera lens
- Use in complete darkness
- Ignore the arrow direction
- Expect perfect accuracy indoors (GPS struggles)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Sensors Used:**

1. **Camera (expo-camera)**
   - Captures live video feed
   - Runs at 30fps
   - Uses back camera
   - No recording - just live view

2. **GPS (expo-location)**
   - Best for navigation accuracy
   - Updates every 1 second
   - Accurate to ~5-15 meters outdoors
   - Less accurate indoors

3. **Magnetometer (expo-sensors)**
   - Detects magnetic north
   - Updates 10 times per second
   - Calculates device heading
   - Can drift - may need recalibration

### **Calculations:**

**Bearing to Target:**
```typescript
bearing = atan2(
  sin(Δlon) * cos(lat2),
  cos(lat1) * sin(lat2) - sin(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(Δlon)
) * 180 / π
```

**Direction Relative to User:**
```typescript
relativeAngle = targetBearing - deviceHeading
// Normalize to -180 to 180
```

**Distance:**
```typescript
// Haversine formula
distance = 2 * R * asin(sqrt(
  sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin²(Δlon/2)
))
```

### **AR Overlay Rendering:**

- Arrow rotates using CSS transform
- Updates every 100ms (10 FPS)
- Green when within ±15° of target
- Size scales based on screen size
- Text updates based on angle thresholds

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Arrow pointing wrong direction?**

**Cause:** Magnetometer needs calibration

**Fix:**
1. Wave phone in figure-8 pattern
2. Do this several times
3. Arrow should correct itself
4. On iPhone: Settings → Privacy → Location → System Services → Compass Calibration

### **Arrow spinning/erratic?**

**Cause:** Magnetic interference

**Fix:**
- Move away from metal objects
- Don't use near cars, elevators, large appliances
- Go to open area
- Restart app if needed

### **Distance not updating?**

**Cause:** GPS signal lost

**Fix:**
- Move near windows (better GPS)
- Go outside briefly
- Check location permissions
- Ensure Location Services are enabled

### **Camera shows black screen?**

**Cause:** Camera permission denied or camera in use

**Fix:**
- Check camera permissions in Settings
- Close other apps using camera
- Restart app
- Restart phone if needed

### **"Straight Ahead" but should turn?**

**Cause:** Need to walk a bit more for GPS to update

**Fix:**
- Keep walking 5-10 meters
- GPS updates with movement
- Stop and wait if distance changes
- Trust the arrow direction over text

## 🎯 When to Use Each

### Use **AR View** when:
- ✅ Within 500m of destination
- ✅ In complex environments (many hallways)
- ✅ Want immersive experience
- ✅ Need real-time visual guidance
- ✅ Walking (not driving)
- ✅ Have good battery (> 30%)

### Use **Map View** when:
- ✅ Viewing multiple orders
- ✅ Planning route
- ✅ Want 3D building view
- ✅ Conserving battery
- ✅ Indoors with poor GPS

### Use **External Maps** when:
- ✅ Long distance (> 1km)
- ✅ Driving
- ✅ Need voice guidance
- ✅ Complex turn-by-turn navigation
- ✅ Unfamiliar with area

---

## 🚀 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Map View** to get general direction, then **switch to AR** for final approach
2. **Calibrate compass** before starting (figure-8 motion)
3. **Hold phone vertical** for best arrow visibility
4. **Walk slowly** for more accurate GPS
5. **Use near windows** when indoors
6. **Point camera forward** not at ground
7. **Trust the arrow** even if it seems wrong initially
8. **Give it 5-10 seconds** to stabilize after starting
9. **Recalibrate** if arrow spins or seems off
10. **Close when done** to save battery

## 🎓 Understanding the Arrow

The arrow is **smart**:
- **Blue** = Still navigating
- **Green** = Pointing the right way (±15°)
- **Rotates smoothly** as you turn
- **Disappears** when you've arrived
- **Size** = Big enough to see while walking
- **Position** = Always centered

**What the arrow ISN'T:**
- ❌ Not showing obstacles
- ❌ Not showing turn-by-turn streets
- ❌ Not showing indoor routes
- ❌ Not GPS perfect (5-15m accuracy)

**What the arrow IS:**
- ✅ Showing compass direction to destination
- ✅ Updating in real-time
- ✅ Considering your current heading
- ✅ "As the crow flies" direction
