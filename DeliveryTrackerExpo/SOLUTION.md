# üîß THE REAL SOLUTION

## The Problem
Building from Xcode shows "No development server found" even though Metro is running.

## Why This Happens
When you use `expo-dev-client`, the app needs special configuration that Expo's CLI sets up automatically. Building directly from Xcode bypasses this setup.

## ‚úÖ THE WORKING SOLUTION

**Don't build from Xcode directly!** Instead, use Expo CLI which handles everything:

```bash
cd /Users/whoisnva/Desktop/IcebreakersIndoors/DeliveryTrackerExpo
npx expo run:ios --device
```

This command will:
1. ‚úÖ Start Metro bundler with correct configuration
2. ‚úÖ Build the native app with proper settings
3. ‚úÖ Set up the connection between app and Metro
4. ‚úÖ Install on your iPhone
5. ‚úÖ Launch the app successfully

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Kill any existing processes
```bash
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9
```

### 2. Run the app
```bash
cd /Users/whoisnva/Desktop/IcebreakersIndoors/DeliveryTrackerExpo
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### 3. Select your iPhone when prompted

### 4. Wait for build (2-3 minutes first time)

### 5. App launches successfully! üéâ

## Why Not Xcode Directly?

When using `expo-dev-client` with native modules like IndoorAtlas:

‚ùå **Xcode direct build:**
- Doesn't set up Metro connection properly
- Missing Expo-specific configurations
- Shows "No development server found"

‚úÖ **Expo CLI (`npx expo run:ios`):**
- Starts Metro with correct settings
- Configures native build properly
- Sets up dev client connection
- Just works!

## For Future Development

### Daily Workflow:

**Option 1: Let Expo handle everything**
```bash
npx expo run:ios --device
```

**Option 2: Keep Metro running, rebuild when needed**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start once, keep running
npx expo start --dev-client

# Terminal 2 - When you need to rebuild
npx expo run:ios --device --no-build-cache
```

## Quick Test Now

Run this command:
```bash
cd /Users/whoisnva/Desktop/IcebreakersIndoors/DeliveryTrackerExpo
npx expo run:ios --device
```

Select your iPhone, and it will work! üöÄ
