# Advanced Positioning System for Delivery Tracking

This document describes the advanced positioning system implemented for accurate location tracking in the delivery tracking application, supporting both indoor and outdoor environments including cruise ships, bars, restaurants, and other venues.

## Overview

The system provides sub-meter accuracy location tracking by fusing multiple positioning technologies:

- **Continuous High-Accuracy GNSS** - BestForNavigation with background updates
- **3D Spatial Modeling** - Venue-aware positioning with floor detection
- **AR/VIO Fusion** - Visual-inertial odometry for indoor tracking
- **BLE Beacons/UWB** - Anchor-based trilateration
- **Mesh Network** - Phone-based mesh networking and delivery optimization

## Venue-Specific Optimizations

### Moving Platform Detection (Cruise Ships)
- Analyzes IMU patterns to detect ship motion vs user movement
- Separates low-frequency ship movement from user activity
- Adjusts motion thresholds for maritime environments

### Indoor Venue Optimization (Bars/Restaurants)
- Enhanced BLE beacon coverage for precise room-level positioning
- Zone-based positioning for different venue areas (bar, seating, kitchen)
- Staff device coordination for efficient order delivery

### GNSS Configuration
```typescript
{
  accuracy: Location.Accuracy.BestForNavigation,
  timeInterval: 500-1000, // Continuous updates
  distanceInterval: 0,    // No distance filtering
  activityType: Location.ActivityType.OtherNavigation, // Optimized for various venues
}
```

### Motion Compensation
- Platform motion filtering prevents false walking detection on moving venues (cruise ships)
- Dynamic Kalman filter process noise adaptation for different environments
- Venue-specific motion pattern recognition and compensation

## Accuracy Improvements

### Multi-Layer Filtering
1. **Quality Check** - Reject readings with poor accuracy (>15-20m)
2. **Jump Detection** - Detect unrealistic position changes
3. **Kalman Filter** - Smooth position estimates over time
4. **Moving Average** - Reduce noise with weighted averaging
5. **Stationary Lock** - Lock position when user is stationary

### Indoor Positioning
- Visual-inertial odometry for precise relative positioning
- Phone-based mesh triangulation for position coordination
- BLE beacon trilateration for room-level accuracy
- UWB ranging for sub-meter precision

### Mesh Network Benefits
- Phone-to-phone position triangulation
- Bar staff device coordination
- Real-time position sharing between customer phones and bar systems
- Delivery route optimization based on phone proximity

## Usage

### Basic Integration
```typescript
import EnhancedMotionService from './services/EnhancedMotionService';

const motionService = new EnhancedMotionService({
  onPositionUpdate: (position) => {
    console.log(`Position: ${position.accuracy.toFixed(2)}m accuracy`);
    console.log(`Sources: ${position.sources.map(s => s.type).join(', ')}`);
  },
  onAccuracyImproved: (accuracy) => {
    console.log(`Accuracy improved to ${accuracy.toFixed(2)}m`);
  },
  targetAccuracy: 1.0, // 1 meter target
  enableAdvancedPositioning: true
});

await motionService.startEnhancedMonitoring();
```

### Advanced Usage
```typescript
import FusedPositioningService from './services/FusedPositioningService';

const positioning = new FusedPositioningService({
  venueId: 'cruise_ship_deck_7',
  cruiseShipMode: true,
  targetAccuracy: 0.5, // 50cm target
  onPositionUpdate: (position) => {
    if (position.metadata.cruiseMode) {
      // Handle cruise ship specific logic
    }
    if (position.metadata.indoorMode) {
      // Enhanced indoor features
    }
  }
});

await positioning.startFusedPositioning();

// Get delivery optimization
const optimization = positioning.optimizeDeliveryRoute('customer_123');
console.log(`Recommended bar: ${optimization.recommendedBar}`);
```

## Configuration

### Venue Model Setup
```typescript
const venueModel = {
  id: 'venue_example',
  name: 'Sample Venue - Main Floor',
  coordinateSystem: {
    origin: { latitude: 25.7612, longitude: -80.1923, altitude: 25 },
    rotation: 0, // degrees from north
    scale: 1.0   // meters per unit
  },
  floors: [{
    level: 1,
    elevation: 0, // meters above reference level
    zones: [
      {
        id: 'main_bar',
        type: 'bar',
        polygon: [/* 3D coordinates */]
      }
    ]
  }]
};
```

### Beacon Anchor Setup
```typescript
const beaconAnchors = [
  {
    id: 'bar_main_beacon',
    uuid: 'E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0',
    major: 1, minor: 1,
    position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 2.5 },
    type: 'ibeacon'
  }
